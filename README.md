# Prediction-of-the-compressive-strength-of-paving-blocks
 Linear regression is use as statistical method used into predict the compressive strength of paving blocks based on input variables such as the amount of sand and plastic used, weight, and maximum load. This allows for optimizing the mix design of the blocks to achieve the desired strength.
